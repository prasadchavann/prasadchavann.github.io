Crafted endpoints for blog generation using Python’s Fast API framework, in which the Gemini Flash model is used with Lang chain’s pipelines to generate SEO friendly blog post’s according to users input topic.

### Technologies used:
- Python
- Langchain
- Fast API (endpoints)
- Mongo DB
- Pydantic, Type checking

### Approach:
- Created Fast API end points for generating blog post and Jinja templates for rendering them.
- Used Lang chain's framework for implementing Google Gemini generative AI chat service for blog content generation.
- Validation using pydantic, type checking.
- Fed the blog posts to Mongo DB, used secure data transfer mechanism, Encryption.
- Endpoints for showing all posts and specific post. 

### Skills I gained:
- Python Fast API
- Pydantic Type checking
- Mongo DB encrypted data storing
- Lang chain prompting
